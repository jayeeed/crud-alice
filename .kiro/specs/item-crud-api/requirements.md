# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a FastAPI-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API system for managing items. The system provides a RESTful API interface for item management with PostgreSQL database persistence, comprehensive error handling, and health monitoring capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to create new items with user_id, name, and price, so that I can store item data in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /items with valid item data THEN the system SHALL create a new item in the database
2. WHEN creating an item THEN the system SHALL generate a unique UUID for the item ID
3. WHEN item creation is successful THEN the system SHALL return the created item with its generated ID
4. IF item creation fails due to database error THEN the system SHALL return a 500 status code with error details
5. WHEN invalid data is provided THEN the system SHALL return appropriate validation errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to retrieve items from the system, so that I can access stored item data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to /items THEN the system SHALL return all items in the database
2. WHEN a GET request is made to /items/{item_id} with valid UUID THEN the system SHALL return the specific item
3. IF an item with the requested ID does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 status code
4. IF an invalid UUID format is provided THEN the system SHALL return a 400 status code
5. WHEN database query fails THEN the system SHALL return a 500 status code with error details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to update existing items, so that I can modify item information when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PUT request is made to /items/{item_id} with update data THEN the system SHALL update all provided fields
2. WHEN a PATCH request is made to /items/{item_id} with partial data THEN the system SHALL update only the provided fields
3. IF the item to update does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 status code
4. IF no fields are provided for update THEN the system SHALL return a 400 status code
5. WHEN update is successful THEN the system SHALL return the updated item data
6. IF update fails due to database error THEN the system SHALL rollback the transaction and return a 500 status code

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to delete items from the system, so that I can remove unwanted item data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DELETE request is made to /items/{item_id} with valid UUID THEN the system SHALL remove the item from the database
2. IF the item to delete does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 status code
3. IF an invalid UUID format is provided THEN the system SHALL return a 400 status code
4. WHEN deletion is successful THEN the system SHALL return a success message
5. IF deletion fails due to database error THEN the system SHALL rollback the transaction and return a 500 status code

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want health monitoring capabilities, so that I can ensure the system is running properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to /health THEN the system SHALL check database connectivity
2. IF database connection is successful THEN the system SHALL return healthy status
3. IF database connection fails THEN the system SHALL return unhealthy status with error details
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize periodic health checks
5. WHEN the application shuts down THEN the system SHALL stop the health check scheduler

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API operation is performed THEN the system SHALL log the operation details
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details with appropriate log levels
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL rollback transactions to maintain data integrity
4. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses
5. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the database schema if needed

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to test data validation, so that I can verify my request format before actual operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /test with item data THEN the system SHALL validate the data format
2. WHEN validation is successful THEN the system SHALL return the validated data structure
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate validation error messages
4. WHEN accessing the root endpoint THEN the system SHALL return API information and available endpoints
